# Description
A professional portfolio to display work samples to potential employers so that they can assess whether I may a be a good candidate for an open position.
# User Story
- AS AN employer
- I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
- SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work:

- WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
